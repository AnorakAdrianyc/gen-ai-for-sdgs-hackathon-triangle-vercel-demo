# Hong Kong 3D Map

A minimal full-window React + TypeScript map, built with Vite, MapLibre GL JS and Tailwind CSS. The default camera looks across Victoria Harbour at a 58° pitch. OpenFreeMap's dark vector style supplies land, coastline, water, roads and labels from OpenStreetMap-compatible data.

## Run locally

Use Node.js 22.12+ or 24 LTS.

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed by Vite. No API key or environment file is required. Internet access is required for public vector tiles, styles, fonts and sprites; this is not an offline map. WebGL must be enabled.

```sh
npm run build    # TypeScript check and production build
npm run preview  # Serve the production build locally
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Deploy the generated `dist/` directory to any static host after `npm run build`. Environment settings are embedded at build time; rebuild after changing them.

## Controls

- Drag to pan; scroll/pinch or use + / − to zoom.
- Right-drag or Ctrl-drag to rotate and tilt. On touch screens, use two fingers to rotate or tilt.
- The compass indicates north; click it to restore north-up and drag it to rotate.
- The reset button returns to the initial harbour camera.
- Focus the map canvas: arrow keys pan, + / − zoom, Shift + left/right rotate, and Shift + up/down change pitch.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` if you want to change the map style, camera, or building schema. Invalid numeric settings fall back to the defaults. Restart Vite after editing environment files.

The default style is `https://tiles.openfreemap.org/styles/dark`; no token is needed. A replacement must be a MapLibre-compatible vector style with a building source. Set `VITE_BUILDING_SOURCE`, `VITE_BUILDING_SOURCE_LAYER`, and the height/base property names to match it. Heights must be numeric meters. If a provider requires a token, put its **public browser token**, restricted to your deployment domains, in `VITE_MAP_STYLE_URL` according to its documentation. Every `VITE_*` setting is visible to visitors: never put private credentials there.

## Building heights

The extrusion layer uses the provider's `render_height` and `render_min_height` values directly, without exaggeration or generated skyscrapers. Missing or nonnumeric heights resolve to zero, leaving those footprints flat. OpenMapTiles can derive render heights from OSM levels or provider defaults when surveyed heights are unavailable, so these values are source-based, not a guarantee of surveyed accuracy. Coverage varies by location and zoom. Buildings appear from zoom 13, below text labels. This view uses a flat ground plane; terrain elevation is outside the scope of this version.

## Structure

```text
src/
  App.tsx                     App entry
  main.tsx                    React root and CSS imports
  styles.css                  Tailwind and basic MapLibre control styling
  components/HongKongMap.tsx   Map lifecycle, navigation, reset, loading/error UI
  map/config.ts               Environment settings and initial camera
  map/buildings.ts            Source-based 3D extrusion layer
  map/appearance.ts           Dark map colors and label contrast
```

MapLibre owns rendering and interaction; React does not re-render on camera movements. Cleanup removes the map and resize observer, including during development Strict Mode remounts.
